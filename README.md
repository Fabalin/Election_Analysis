Analyzing Election Poll Data Using Python

## Project Overview 
A Colorado Board of Elections employee had asked to analyze the polling data of a local congressional election. Python programming language was used to read the poll results contained within a csv file. The output of the analysis was summarized in a text file following the criteria specified below:

  1. The total number of votes cast. 
  2. A List of candidates who recieved votes. 
  3. Calculate each candidate's total number of votes. 
  4. Calculate the each candidate's percentage of votes recieved.
  5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote count.  

### Challenge Overview 
The challenge used the desgin pattern of the project to perform a similar analysis and determine the county with the largest voter turnout. The criteria to be displayed in the text file includes:

  1. A list of counties where votes were cast.
  2. The total number of votes cast by each county. 
  3. The percentage of votes cast by each county. 
  4. Determine the county with the largest turnout based on popular vote.

## Election-Audit Results  
- How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
- Which county had the largest number of votes?
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
- Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

## Election-Audit Summary 
In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
